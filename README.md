Point-NeRF uses neural 3D point clouds, with associated neural features, to model a radiance field. Point-NeRF can be rendered efficiently by aggregating neural point features near scene surfaces, in a ray marching-based rendering pipeline. Moreover, Point-NeRF can be initialized via direct inference of a pre-trained deep network to produce a neural point cloud; this point cloud can be finetuned to surpass the visual quality of NeRF with 30X faster training time. Point-NeRF can be combined with other 3D reconstruction methods and handles the errors and outliers in such methods via a novel pruning and growing mechanism.

## Updates ##
1. To replace pycuda, we have implemented the pytorch cuda functions when using world coordinates to group neural points. Simply set wcoord_query=-1
in your configuration file if the original setting is wcoord_query=1 (see dev_scripts/w_n360/chair_cuda.sh).
2. We have received constructive feedbacks that when Point-NeRF use MVSNet to reconstruct point cloud, the point fusion after depth estimation by MVSNet will use the alpha channel information in the NeRF-Synthetic Dataset. It is due to the fact that MVSNet cannot handle background very well. To improve the fairness, we include new training scripts and results of PointNeRF + MVSNet when using background color for filtering.  The results (see below) are similar to the ones that are previously reported.

| | Chair |	Drums	| Lego	| Mic	| Materials	| Ship	| Hotdog	| Ficus | Avg |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | --- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ------- | ------- |------- |
| PSNR | 35.60 | 26.04	| 35.27	| 35.91	| 29.65	| 30.61 |	37.34 | 35.61	| 33.25 |
| SSIM  | 0.991	| 0.954	| 0.989	| 0.994	| 0.971	| 0.938	| 0.991	| 0.992	| 0.978 |
| LPIPSVgg | 0.023	| 0.078	| 0.021	| 0.014	| 0.071	| 0.129 | 0.036	| 0.025 | 0.050 |
| LPIPSAlex | 0.010	| 0.055	| 0.010	| 0.007	| 0.041	| 0.076	| 0.016	| 0.011	| 0.028 |

This issue only affacts situations when Point-NeRF uses MVSNet on NeRF-Synthetic Dataset. The Colmap results and results on other datasets are not impacted.    
An even more reasonable reconstruction approach should exclude using the knowledge of background color or other point filtering. Therefore, we suggest users to combine PointNeRF with more powerful MVS models, such as [TransMVS](https://github.com/megvii-research/TransMVSNet).

## Point Initialization / Generalization:
### &nbsp; Download pre-trained MVSNet checkpoints:
We trained [MVSNet](https://github.com/xy-guo/MVSNet_pytorch) on DTU. You can Download ''MVSNet'' directory from 
[google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xk1GhDhgPk1MrlX8ncfBz5hNMvSa9vS6?usp=sharing)
and place them under '''checkpoints/'''

### &nbsp;  Train 2D feature extraction and point representation
#####  &nbsp; Directly use our trained checkpoints files:
Download ''init'' directory from 
[google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xk1GhDhgPk1MrlX8ncfBz5hNMvSa9vS6?usp=sharing).
and place them under '''checkpoints/'''

##### &nbsp; Or train from scratch:
Train for point features of 63 channels (as in paper) 
```
bash dev_scripts/ete/dtu_dgt_d012_img0123_conf_color_dir_agg2.sh
```
Train for point features of 32 channels (better for per-scene optimization)
```
bash dev_scripts/ete/dtu_dgt_d012_img0123_conf_agg2_32_dirclr20.sh
```
After the training, you should pick a checkpoint and rename it to best checkpoint, e.g.:
```
cp checkpoints/dtu_dgt_d012_img0123_conf_color_dir_agg2/250000_net_ray_marching.pth  checkpoints/dtu_dgt_d012_img0123_conf_color_dir_agg2/best_net_ray_marching.pth

cp checkpoints/dtu_dgt_d012_img0123_conf_color_dir_agg2/250000_net_mvs.pth  checkpoints/dtu_dgt_d012_img0123_conf_color_dir_agg2/best_net_mvs.pth
```

### Per-scene optimize from scatch 
Make sure the ''checkpoints'' folder has ''init'' and ''MVSNet''.
The training scripts will start to do initialization if there is no ''.pth'' files in a scene folder. It will start from the last ''.pth'' files until reach the iteration of ''maximum_step''.
