Point-NeRF uses neural 3D point clouds, with associated neural features, to model a radiance field. Point-NeRF can be rendered efficiently by aggregating neural point features near scene surfaces, in a ray marching-based rendering pipeline. Moreover, Point-NeRF can be initialized via direct inference of a pre-trained deep network to produce a neural point cloud; this point cloud can be finetuned to surpass the visual quality of NeRF with 30X faster training time. Point-NeRF can be combined with other 3D reconstruction methods and handles the errors and outliers in such methods via a novel pruning and growing mechanism.

  ```

## Point Initialization / Generalization:
### &nbsp; Download pre-trained MVSNet checkpoints:
We trained [MVSNet](https://github.com/xy-guo/MVSNet_pytorch) on DTU. You can Download ''MVSNet'' directory from 
[google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xk1GhDhgPk1MrlX8ncfBz5hNMvSa9vS6?usp=sharing)
and place them under '''checkpoints/'''

### &nbsp;  Train 2D feature extraction and point representation
#####  &nbsp; Directly use our trained checkpoints files:
Download ''init'' directory from 
[google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xk1GhDhgPk1MrlX8ncfBz5hNMvSa9vS6?usp=sharing).
and place them under '''checkpoints/'''

##### &nbsp; Or train from scratch:
Train for point features of 63 channels (as in paper) 
```
bash dev_scripts/ete/dtu_dgt_d012_img0123_conf_color_dir_agg2.sh
```
Train for point features of 32 channels (better for per-scene optimization)
```
bash dev_scripts/ete/dtu_dgt_d012_img0123_conf_agg2_32_dirclr20.sh
```
After the training, you should pick a checkpoint and rename it to best checkpoint, e.g.:
```
cp checkpoints/dtu_dgt_d012_img0123_conf_color_dir_agg2/250000_net_ray_marching.pth  checkpoints/dtu_dgt_d012_img0123_conf_color_dir_agg2/best_net_ray_marching.pth

cp checkpoints/dtu_dgt_d012_img0123_conf_color_dir_agg2/250000_net_mvs.pth  checkpoints/dtu_dgt_d012_img0123_conf_color_dir_agg2/best_net_mvs.pth
```
### &nbsp; Test feed forward inference on dtu scenes 
These scenes that are selected by MVSNeRF, please also refer their code to understand the metrics calculation.

### Per-scene optimize from scatch 
Make sure the ''checkpoints'' folder has ''init'' and ''MVSNet''.
The training scripts will start to do initialization if there is no ''.pth'' files in a scene folder. It will start from the last ''.pth'' files until reach the iteration of ''maximum_step''.
